                <p>On an exclusive and retained basis JONES PARTNERS has led cross-functional search engagements supporting client growth. Client quotes have been embedded in this website to help anyone understand JONES PARTNERS’ history and anticipated contributions.
                    For more than 20 years, Pamela Jones has managed long-term client relationships serving start-up, emerging, and transitioning technology, education, food/agriculture, and manufacturing companies nationwide. With deep cross-functional assessment, her firm has recruited C-level executive team members and critical leadership to execute on projected growth plans. To date, the firm has a record of only nine job offers turned down in their history.
                    She has positioned clients for future growth, acquisitions, and IPO’s by partnering directly at the Board and the executive team level. Retained search, management consulting supporting growth, tech transfers, and/or turnarounds include Cascade Microtech, Inc. (now FormFactor), Digimarc, MedicaLogic (now GE), Vocollect, Inc. (now Honeywell), Claremont Technology Group (now HP), Naturxan (now Archer Daniels Midland), NWEA, Multi-Modal (now 3M) and more.                
                    By word of mouth only and beyond semiconductors, initial products expanded to include voice computing, speech recognition, AI neural networks, and embedded connectivity software along with deep SaaS enterprise solutions – all reflecting proprietary technology.               
                    The largest VC firm based in Seattle encouraged Pamela to establish her own organization after assessing her impact at Lattice Semiconductor. As part of the founding group at Lattice, she served on the executive management team. With ownership of prior assessment, 75% of the individuals invited inhouse for first interviews became employees.
                    Earlier in her career, Ms. Jones provided management consulting services and retained executive search serving a variety of industries while with a major accounting firm.
                    Even earlier, Ms. Jones managed corporate human resource functions for a Chicago- based Fortune 500 company, initially beginning as the cross-functional business analyst for the President & Chairman of the Board.                
                    Community Service:                
                    Board member for the Software Association of Oregon (now Technology Association of Oregon) for 15 contiguous years. Chaired the Human Capital Forum for 5 years.
                    Board member at OPB for 6 years (Oregon Public Broadcasting).
                    Former Board member, Oregon Entrepreneurs Network (OEN) serving on the Board for 10 years with continued support (recruited the Executive Director serving a 17-year span).
                    Associated Oregon Industries Board member (at the time - Oregon’s largest business lobby with 22,000-member companies) for 8 years and Chaired the Technology & Education Policy Committee in 2004 when House Bill 3613 was authored by this Committee. Following Legislative approval, the Bill was signed into law by Oregon’s Governor resulting in $100M of new venture capital.
                    Past advisory board relationships include: Neighborhood House (100+year-old social service non-profit), Entrepreneurs Foundation Northwest, Saturday Academy, West Coast Chamber Orchestra, and the MetroArts Foundation.

                    <p>Quality Time, Quality Results:
                        Our search and assessment methodologies genuinely allow true selection on the part of our client company. Only six employment offers have been turned down in more than 20 years.  
                        With our 89% return rate from an installed client base, we believe this signifies an appreciation for impact on the business, the cultural assessment and the behavioral fit. 
                        Our shortest CEO search on record lasted two and-one half weeks.
                        Our longest search on record (a GM for a publicly-held company) lasted one year at the CEO's request during our data collection interviews. The first Candidate interviewed at the onset of the engagement withstood the test of time and was ultimately hired!                  
                        We listen to our clients. We discuss, develop and lead processes that benefit our client's business challenges.

                <div id="abt-ethics-section">
                    <p>Ethics and Loyalty:
                        We do not compromise our business ethics and client loyalties. Should any executive want to leave employment with a JONES PARTNERS' client, the CEO needs to personally support the decision with a phone call.
                        The firm has always served as a confidential consultative sounding board for executives requiring a safe, objective environment and constructive real-time options.
                        We serve successful growth companies and select new client companies carefully. Consideration of the existing leadership, the potential of the product(s) and the anticipated market remains critical.
                        JONES PARTNERS will not serve new clients where direct competition on product lines will compromise existing relationships.

                <div id="abt-backgrounds-section">
                    <p>JONES PARTNERS focuses on profitable impact with their client base. Their client empathy comes from prior experience that reflects successful operational leadership (Fortune 500 to start-up), founding group executive leadership within high tech (Lattice Semiconductor), and deep cross-functional assessment of organizational effectiveness within large and small growth environments.

                    “Pamela’s Superstar abilities are proven – having earned participation in a life changing experience by building the startup team for Lattice Semiconductor; the world’s most profitable, cash-positive semiconductor company, the world’s first fabless semiconductor company, the world’s first CMOS EEPROM technology to go into volume production, and Oregon’s first successful startup semiconductor company with a sustainable competitive advantage lasting over decades to this day.”
               Rahul Sud, Founding CEO 
               Lattice Semiconductor, LLC
                    "What I’ve observed over the years working with Jones Partners is a wonderful combination of professionalism, dedication, integrity, and insight. They take the time to learn the real needs of an organization, and assure that candidates fit not only in terms of skill sets but in terms of shared values and culture. As a result, their placements are remarkably effective, and their candidates add real value to the organization." 
               Matt Chapman, Retired CEO 
               The Northwest Evaluation Association 
               Portland, OR
                    "Jones Partners has been instrumental in hiring almost all of Vocollect's senior management team. Over the years I've worked with Pamela I've really appreciated not only her strong interest in understanding our business and our people in great detail and her keen insights into employment candidates, but also the ability her industry background gives her to act as an informal advisor on much broader issues. And on top of all that, Jones Partners' most unusual 'pay as you go' business model seems to me to make far more sense than the traditional fee structures. I'd strongly recommend Jones Partners to anyone looking to add high quality senior management talent to a technology company." 
               Roger Byford, Chairman of the Board, Founder & CTO 
               Vocollect, Inc. 
               Pittsburgh, PA
                    “When looking for executive talent, Jones Partners is the best recruiting firm I have found. I have used them for CFO, VP of Sales and VP of HR searches as well as Director level searches. They always produce qualified Candidates in a short amount of time and I have been very satisfied with the people I eventually hired. The firm receives my highest recommendation.“
               Dave Moffenbeier, COO and Board Member 
               Absorbent Technologies, Inc.
