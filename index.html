                    For more than 20 years, Pamela Jones has managed long-term client relationships serving start-up, emerging, and transitioning technology, education, food/agriculture, and manufacturing companies nationwide. With deep cross-functional assessment, her firm has recruited C-level executive team members and critical leadership to execute on projected growth plans. To date, the firm has a record of only nine job offers turned down in their history.

                    <br/>
                    She has positioned clients for future growth, acquisitions, and IPO’s by partnering directly at the Board and the executive team level. Retained search, management consulting supporting growth, tech transfers, and/or turnarounds include Cascade Microtech, Inc. (now FormFactor), Digimarc, MedicaLogic (now GE), Vocollect, Inc. (now Honeywell), Claremont Technology Group (now HP), Naturxan (now Archer Daniels Midland), NWEA, Multi-Modal (now 3M) and more.

                            The largest VC firm based in Seattle encouraged Pamela to establish her own organization after assessing her impact at Lattice Semiconductor. As part of the founding group at Lattice, she served on the executive management team. With ownership of prior assessment, 75% of the individuals invited inhouse for first interviews became employees.

                        For more than 20 years we have focused on retained executive search and consistently enjoyed serving the nation’s technology, healthcare and food processing industries. JONES PARTNERS has established an outstanding track record delivering cross-functional C-level executives and senior leaders on an exclusive basis. Client companies are often venture- backed and range from start-up to emerging high growth public companies.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The firm is credited with a series of turnarounds where all clients (if not already public) subsequently completed an IPO. Part of JONES PARTNERS’ revenue stream includes serving on acquisition or transition management teams requiring functional and leadership assessment.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Half of JONES PARTNERS' annual revenue continues to reflect a client base beyond the Pacific Northwest. Eighty-nine (89%) percent of the searches completed in the past few years were initiated by clients previously served. A continued focus on assessment and results with the benefit of long-term retention is a defining attribute associated with the firm's success. Client testimonials reflect entire management team searches and a series of engagements over time ......... as business dynamics spur growth, or at the early-stage DNA level.

Over the years I've worked with Pamela I've really appreciated not only her strong interest in understanding our business and our people in great detail and her keen insights into employment candidates, but also the ability her industry background gives her to act as an informal advisor on much broader issues. And on top of all that, Jones Partners' most unusual 'pay as you go' business model seems to me to make far more sense than the traditional fee structures. I'd strongly recommend Jones Partners to anyone looking to add high quality senior management talent to a technology company."

                        "Often when working as a Project Manager on a challenging project, I have been excluded from significant client staffing decisions with a direct impact on my project. Jones Partners included our firm (IBM Global Services) in the selection process and professionally managed all stakeholders needs through the selection of an excellent CIO Candidate. I would recommend Jones Partners to anyone seeking assistance in filling a senior professional position."
